Adds Beetle people into the game. I made this mod to add variety without cluttering up crafting or item menus. It does not add anything except for the race itself and a faction.

Beetle people are:
+ Resilient to extreme disease and toxic environments
+ fast
- slower farmers
- unable to wear headgear and can only wear certain items

Requires Alien Race Framework 2.0
